<h4>The results of an online learning style test retrieved from <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=5&V=8&T=7">educationplanner</a></h4>

My Scores:
<br>
Auditory: 25%<br>
Visual: 40%<br>
Tactile: 35%<br<

<p>I am mostly visual learner, however I should also take in consideration and implement the tactile and auditory learning techniques to achieve the satisfactory studying results.</p>

<h5>Visual</h5>
<p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.

As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.

Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)</li>
<li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Use flashcards to learn new words.</li>
<li>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.</li>

<li>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.</li>
<li>Colour code things.</li>
<li>Avoid distractions during study times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This web application is meant to crumble all numbers provided of an anticipated property purchase and provide the end-user with a detailed analysis of projected costs from start to end, covering costs implied from a conveyancer and buyer’s agent, initial acquisition and renovation costs, maintenance and insurance as well as tax implications. Supported by intuitive, visual representations in the form of bar charts and line graphs, valuable predictions are rendered.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>With a plethora of real estate related analysis applications and home loan focused calculators already available on the internet, none of them combine all information, data and figures into one big picture. While the property acquisition process by itself is time consuming and requires due diligence to be done by the buyer themselves, this web application project aims at taking a huge burden of this process by assisting the buyer in finding a well-thought decision. Whether determining affordability in the long term or a cost comparison of buying versus renting, this application is a one stop to cover them all.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The user facing part of the web application consists of two key pillars that are driving the whole user experience, firstly an input form which captures all information of the buyers financial situation and anticipated property, and secondly the analysis results. All required input data are numbers in the form of dollar amounts, percentages or date figures and can be entered into the form by either typing them out or using a graphical control element, i.e. slider to interact and manipulate the data. To provide clarity about each data field required, a detailed description can be displayed in the form of a pop up notification if the user clicks on a question mark symbol next to the field name. During data entry each field is validated for realistic and reasonable input data, to avoid typing error by the user. A notification next to the field in question is displayed after validation to visibly inform the user of its provided value and to question it’s intention, drawing the users attention to verify the data. Having filled out all input fields, a submit form button can be clicked by the user which will start the analysis routine. Upon success, the user will be forwarded to a dedicated results page, which summarizes all input data and presents the analysis result. The analysis results view is meant to be read and interpreted by the end user in a very intuitive and self-explanatory manner. Aside from graphical visualization with bar charts and line graphs of the predicted data flow, the user receives valuable assistance by also providing text based interpretation of some of the calculated outcomes. An example shall be that based on the user’s circumstances and provided data, he could save a certain amount of dollar paid in interest over the lifetime of his loan entering into the home loan with a higher deposit amount of just a certain dollar figure, which in turn could be saved within one year by reducing living expenses of another dollar figure peer week. This form of visualized and text based feedback of the analysis result actively encourages the user to think of all potential edges and corners involved in the costing process. In order to allow the user to conveniently make adjustments to the previously provided input data without needing to return to the form page, the form can be viewed on the analysis page by clicking on a pull down button. The analysis results are updated in real time while the user adjusts data or drags sliders to increase or decrease figures. After all the user can then decide to email these results to a desired address or even export them as pdf or Excel spreadsheet. One key element of the web application in order to reach self-sustainability of covering running costs or eventually making small profits, discreetly placed online advertisements related to real estate are embedded on various spots on all pages. User experience is in focus and thus no use of distractive or overlapping popup advertisement is made.</p>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>The web application itself can be developed and tested with free, open source software available on the internet and does not incur additional licensing costs. A very popular and swift to learn programming language is Python which combined with Pandas, a data analysis library (Pandas 2019), form a feature rich basis to analyse data and plot them into visual graphs. Costing let alone are incurred by hosting the web application, cost effectively on cloud services. To make the application reachable on the internet, a domain name and additionally website security certificate need to be acquired.</p>

<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>Having chosen Python as the basis, which is considered the fastest-growing major programming language (Stackoverflow 2017), an application developer shall be found with ease. However, an additional requirement is proficiency in data analysis using Pandas and knowledge in using Flask, a lightweight web application framework (Palletsprojects n.d.) for Python. All resources and documentation are freely accessible on the internet. Web services such as Amazon’s Lightsail (Amazon Web Services 2019) allow for a cost-effective setup of the web application without requiring in-depth knowledge or skills.</p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>With the project’s success potential real estate buyers will experience a noticeable cut-down of time invested in research and data comparison, in particular in the form of creating manual spreadsheets and doing the math themselves. A major advantage in using the web application for the buyer is to make sure that all costing aspects, in particular of predictable costs, are covered, easing the decision-making process and more importantly, avoiding the buyer to default on loan. Most importantly this application eases the process for first home buyers to step into the market. </p>
